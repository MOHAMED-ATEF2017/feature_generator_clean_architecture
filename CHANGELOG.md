# Changelog

## [2.4.0] - 2025-06-12

### Changed

- **üöÄ Simplified Use Case Architecture** - The `add-usecase` command now creates standalone models without entity dependencies
- **üìÅ Individual File Creation** - Each use case generates separate files instead of updating existing ones
- **‚ö° Faster Development** - No need to create entity boilerplate, direct model usage for cleaner code
- **üîÑ Entity-Free Architecture** - Models are self-contained with full JSON serialization capabilities

### Features

- `add-usecase` command now creates standalone models with complete JSON serialization
- Individual use case files generated for each new use case
- Shared infrastructure files (data sources, repositories) are created once and reused
- No entity directory or files created - simplified clean architecture approach
- Enhanced code templates with proper dependency injection and error handling

### Improved

- **Documentation** - Updated README.md to clarify that `add-usecase` is optional
- **User Experience** - Clear indication that step 3 (adding use cases) is only needed for extending features
- **Code Generation** - More efficient file creation with better template reuse

## [2.3.0] - 2025-06-10

### Added

- **New `add-usecase` command** - Add individual use cases to existing features without recreating the entire structure
- **Automatic domain entity generation** - Creates domain entities for each use case with proper business object structure
- **Automatic data model generation** - Creates data models with JSON serialization, extending domain entities
- **Enhanced Clean Architecture compliance** - Use cases now work with specific entities instead of generic models
- **üÜï Automatic PATH configuration** - The `install` command now automatically adds `$HOME/.pub-cache/bin` to your shell PATH
- Automatic updates to repository interfaces, implementations, and data sources when adding new use cases
- Enhanced CLI with `--feature` and `--usecase` flags for the new command
- Comprehensive documentation and examples for the new functionality

### Features

- `feature_generator add-usecase --feature=auth --usecase=resetPassword` - Add new use cases to existing features
- Automatic file updates maintain clean architecture structure
- Validates existing feature structure before adding new use cases
- Generates complete use case files with proper imports and exports
- Creates domain entities with equality operators and toString methods
- Creates data models with fromJson, toJson, and copyWith methods
- Updates repository methods to use specific entity types
- **üÜï Shell detection and automatic PATH configuration** - Supports Bash, Zsh, and Fish shells
